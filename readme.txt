Project Title: 
Monthly Fee Management System for Private Kindergarten

Description: 
The goal of this project is to develop a monthly fee management system for a 
private kindergarten to efficiently track and manage the monthly payment record.
The system will support for user types, each with distinct access permissions.

Types of Users:
1) Admin (Highest Level)
2) Accountant
3) Teachers
4) Parents

Tasks:
1) Admin (Highest Level)
- Manages the entire system, including user roles, system settings, and school-wide
financial data. Sets up fee structures, discounts, and penalties for late payments.
Manage access permissions for other roles.

2) Accountant
- Manages student fee records: adds, updates, and marks fees as paid. Generates 
report on fees, overdue payments, and general financial health. Generates
monthly fee invoices for parents. Tracks due dates and flags overdue accounts for
follow-up. Generates and prints individual or bulk reports on fee collection status

3) Teachers
- Views fee status for the students in their respective classes or groups. Sends
reminders to parents (if integrated with messaging or emails). Limited access to 
financial data and primarily interacts with the student and fee overview.

4) Parents
Views their child's fee details, including due dates, amount due, and any penalties.
Pays fees online or marks a payment as complete if offline (this would be validated
by the accountant). Receives notifications for upcoming fees, overdue fees, and 
payment confirmations. Can view payment history and download receipts.
